Current Projects I amTinkering with:
- A game Engine/framework in c# using silk.net
- A UEFI Compliant OS Bootloader with Kernel
- - Creating a Project for making Virtual Disk Images a json definition, part of OS Project as a quicker way to create images for real and virtual testing that can be passed around.
      Plan to make this it's own project in the future.
- - Created a Qemu Command Builder in C# for quick virtualization for OS Testing, current just runs as the main project in the OS Project to allow me to quickly start a virtual machine,
      plan is to break it out into it's own project an eventually make it a VS Extension that can be used to debug and run UEFI Compliant code from visual studios.
- Writing an Emulator for some old CPUs
