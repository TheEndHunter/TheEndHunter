Been Curious about programming for a long while after finding a passion in playing games when I was younger, wanting to know more iI went to college and did a Game development course that got me hooked on the idea of making my own game at some point.

I Am Currently Re-learning in my own time C++ from the basics and wish to Look into Vulkan, OpenGL, And DirectX 12 iin the future. My Currrent Goal is to make a Game Engine or Game in the future with the knowledge. But for now I am going to build up to it with other projects.
